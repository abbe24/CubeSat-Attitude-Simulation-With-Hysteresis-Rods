This zip file contains the MATLAB code, Stk simulation and files, reports, and sources for the CDR final detumbling simulation. 

In order to open and view the STK simulation you need to download and unzip the file, then look for the STK Scenario file within the folder (STKFiles), it should have a blue STK logo on the left and it is named (CDRFinalSIm).

within the reports tab you will find a .csv file named (Satellite-GASRATS-To-Facility-USU...) This file contains all access instancs within a 1 week period, totaling in about 7.5 hours of access. or about 1 hour of access a day. These Access windows are around 9 minutes on average. This access is based on a 60 degree cone sensor on the -z axis of the satellite and a ground station object at the latitude and longitude of the USU SER building. 

Within the MATLABCode folder you will find the modified final simulation code which includes the code to write an STK .a attitude file in the format of STK AttitudeTimeQuatAngVels (https://help.agi.com/stk/12.5.0/index.htm#stk/example_AttitudeFile4.htm) This version of the simulation has a timestep decreased from 240 seconds to 10 seconds for increased visual smoothness within the STK 3d window.

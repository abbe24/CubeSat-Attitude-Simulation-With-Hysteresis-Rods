The purpose of this simulation was to calculate the Earth's Mangetic Flux density (H) for a circular orbit at a fixed altitude 
similar to that of the ISS. This simulation sucessfully calculated a spreadsheet of Magnetic Flux Densities felt by the CubeSat
in different parts of its orbit. 

This simulation can be replaced by use of the Magnetic flux density based on the IGRF model data at orbit locations. This 
replacement will be used for the final simulation as it is more accurate when compared to Magnetic Flux Densities felt by other 
satellites in orbit.

# CubeSat-Attitude-Damping-Simulation-with-Hysteresis-Rods
This is a Matlab simulation project in progress for the Utah State GASRATS satellite team. The goal of GASRATS is to test a prototype of a transparent patch antenna, which is a special antenna overlaid on a solar panel to allow power generation on all sides of the cubesat. The team has opted to use a permanent magnet and hysteresis rods for passive detumbling, and myself and the other members of the ADCS subteam have produced this preliminary simulation. 

The Matlab simulation file is named "cubesat_detumble5". This simulation projects a 1U cubesat given the initial conditions to lose at least 90% of its rotation velocity by 500 sec. The simulation was made using Euler’s rigid body rotational kinematics and dynamics equations. A gimball lock on the kinematic equations is required and implemented to prevent division by zero. A photo of the used kinematic and dynamic equations is provided for reference.

The damping simulation has been done with euler kinematics and dynamic equations, and the simulation is being redone using quaternion kinematics and dynamics. See folder under Simulations titled Quaternions with quaternion-implemented simulations.
